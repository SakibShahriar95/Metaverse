### Abstract:

The metaverse is rapidly gaining traction as a transformative technology aimed at merging the physical and virtual worlds. Major corporations, such as Facebook—now rebranded as Meta—are heavily investing in its development. While the metaverse offers exciting opportunities, including virtual meetings and immersive learning environments, it also raises concerns related to data privacy and potential negative impacts on real-life interactions.

This research investigates public sentiments towards the metaverse by analyzing 86,565 metaverse-related tweets. Lexicon-based sentiment analysis was performed, and various machine and deep learning models were applied to predict sentiment classes. The BERT transformer model emerged as the most effective, achieving a remarkable 92.6% accuracy and an F-measure of 0.91 on the test dataset.

The paper also discusses the implications of these findings and suggests directions for future research in understanding and shaping public perceptions of the metaverse.
